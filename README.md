# Teaching and Learning Celestial Navigation Using Google Maps


Here is documentation for the code presented in the paper "Teaching and
Learning Celestial Navigation Using Google Maps" that was published in
the [Journal of
Navigation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-
navigation) (https://doi.org/10.1017/S0373463317000777), published
online: 07 November 2017.

## Quick start

To get up and running quickly, do this:

1. Download celnav.html and the images folder.

2. Wherever you place celnav.html, maintain the structure, in that the 'images' folder is directly branched off of the location
where you put celnav.html.

3. Load celnav.html into a text editor.  Put your Google Maps API key into line 5 (the
long `<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.....>` line.

4. Load celnav.html into your web browser (using its File->Open...) menu option.

You should see a map of a ship and the Sun, near the Hawaiian islands.
